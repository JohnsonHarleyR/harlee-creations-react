Notes for Portfolio Webpage

Name: Harlee's Creations

It will have my software tools and games, a place to buy my stuff, an about me and a blog, and a place to contact me.
POSSIBLY: Also allow users to sign up so they can play games and use tools without having to start over every time. 

Layout: Every page will have a top navigation bar and reusable buttons and such.
